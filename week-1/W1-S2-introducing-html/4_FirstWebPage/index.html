    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      With a decorated background in professional sports—including five
      Hungarian Boxing Championship titles, two European Boxing Championship
      bronze medals, and a European Kickboxing Championship bronze—I bring
      focus, resilience, and a strong work ethic to my career in tech.
      <br />
      After transitioning from quality assurance in the vitamin manufacturing
      industry, I followed my long-standing passion for technology and graduated
      from SheCodes in 2025 as a Front-End Developer.
      <br />
      My studies have covered Python, AI, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap,
      GitHub, Netlify, React, Axios, responsive design, and more.
      <br />
      I’m currently deepening my knowledge of back-end technologies, working
      toward becoming a full-stack developer who builds thoughtful, user-focused
      digital experiences.
